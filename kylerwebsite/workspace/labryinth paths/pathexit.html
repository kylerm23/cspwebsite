Thank God we got out of there.
</br>
Well what do we do now?
</br>
It appears I'm still stuck with you and you didn't say anything this whole time
</br>
You are going to bore me to death if you don't start talking.
</br>
If you keep this up you might as well go back in there and do something
</br>
Why aren't you moving
</br>
Don't tell me we are stuck here...

           Thank you for playing and congrats on completing the labyrinth
           </br>
           You are now stuck here forever
           </br>
           I gotta go because I have a life and stuff to attend to
           </br>
           So umm...
           </br>
           Bye?
