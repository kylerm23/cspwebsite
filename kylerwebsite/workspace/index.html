            Here you can choose to head to my portfolio or the labyrith once I make it.

                So enjoy yourself here. There's stuff I guess.
                </br>
                So first let's think about stuff we can go and see.

        I was worried that this would one day happen. 
        Eventually man comes to destroy itself and then rebuild itself. 
        You can see this after every major war, man destroys and surprisingly advances in one way or another either immediately or later on in the future. 
        We have reached the time for another cycle of destruction and rebirth.

    I also take time to play video games and you can find all the ones I've beaten, not here of course. You have to work to find that one.
